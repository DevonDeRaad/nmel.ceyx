# Input datasets

## Each of the datasets needed to recreate the analyses performed in this manuscript are available in this repository

- The unfiltered SNP dataset containing all samples and SNPs, straight out of the *Stacks* populations module with no filters applied is called [populations.snps.vcf.gz](https://github.com/DevonDeRaad/nmel.ceyx/blob/main/data/populations.snps.vcf.gz).
- The filtered SNP dataset containing all 107 samples that passed filtering and only SNPs that passed filtering is called [filtered.snps.vcf.gz](https://github.com/DevonDeRaad/nmel.ceyx/blob/main/data/filtered.snps.vcf.gz).
- That same filtered SNP dataset pruned for linkage (minimum 10Kb distance between SNPs) is called [filtered.unlinked.snps.vcf.gz](https://github.com/DevonDeRaad/nmel.ceyx/blob/main/data/filtered.unlinked.snps.vcf.gz).
- The table detailing the exact locality and species identity of all samples is called [ceyx.full.sampling.csv](https://github.com/DevonDeRaad/nmel.ceyx/blob/main/data/ceyx.full.sampling.csv).

## Raw Illumina sequence data is available on NCBI
