# Northern Melanesian *Ceyx* RADseq investigation

### This repository will contain documentation of all resources used to analyze the phylogeographic patterns of Northern Melanesian *Ceyx* Kingfishers.

### Mapping
*    All details for creating maps shown in the manuscript can be found in the folder called [mapping](https://github.com/DevonDeRaad/nmel.ceyx/tree/main/mapping).
### Data availability
*   All input files necessary to recreate this study can be accessed via the folder named [data](https://github.com/DevonDeRaad/nmel.ceyx/tree/main/data).

### Quality filtering raw, unfiltered SNPs
*   The entire SNP filtering process, facilitated by the R packages [vcfR](https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.12549) and [SNPfiltR](https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13618) is available to view here:

### Constructing an unrooted, distance-based phylogenetic network
*   The process can be viewed from this link:

### Constructing a maximum-likelihood phylogeny from all samples
*   All input and output files plus code can be found in the folder named [iqtree](https://github.com/DevonDeRaad/nmel.ceyx/tree/main/iqtree).

### Running *ADMIXTURE* on this dataset
*   All input and output files plus code can be found in the folder named [admixture](https://github.com/DevonDeRaad/nmel.ceyx/tree/main/admixture).

### Reconstructing the species tree and assessing diversification
*   All input and output files plus code for making a species tree can be found in the folder named [SNAPP](https://github.com/DevonDeRaad/nmel.ceyx/tree/main/snapp).
*   A detailed walk-through of the process can be viewed [here](https://devonderaad.github.io/nmel.ceyx/snapp/execute.snapp.html).
*   The process of constructing a log-lineage through time (LTT) plot based on the maximum clade credibility tree, and simulating the null distribution of LTT plots based on a pure-birth model can be viewed [here](https://devonderaad.github.io/nmel.ceyx/snapp/LTT.plots.html).

### Testing for gene flow
*    All input and output files from running the program [Dsuite](https://github.com/millanek/Dsuite) can be found in the folder called [dsuite](https://github.com/DevonDeRaad/nmel.ceyx/tree/main/dsuite).
*    A detailed walk-through of the entire process including all code can be viewed [here](https://devonderaad.github.io/nmel.ceyx/dsuite/run.dsuite.html).

### Calculating pariwise FST between lineages
